* List Goal

  Assuming you have configured the Maven JMod Plugin 
  {{{../usage.html}accordingly to the usage page}} like the following:

+----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-jmod-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions>
        <configuration>
          <!-- configuration elements goes here -->
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>list</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>list</goal>
            </goals>
            <phase>verify</phase>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>        
      </plugin>
   [...]
</project>

  During the above call of Maven the <<jmod>> files will be generated and by the <<list>> goal
  you will get an output like the following (using toolchains):
